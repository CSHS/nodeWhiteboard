This is a whiteboard web app built with NodeJS.  It uses the awesome flexibility of socket.io and HTML5 canvas.  It does not yet have much UI nor features added (e.g. different colors,
eraser, etc.).  Those can/will be added in in the very near future.  Feel free to fork and/or submit a pull request to it to add more functionalities.

To test, make sure you have NodeJS installed.
