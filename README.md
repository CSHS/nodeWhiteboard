This is a whiteboard web app built with NodeJS.  It uses the awesome flexibility of socket.io and HTML5 canvas.  It does not yet have much UI nor many features added (e.g. ink thickness, fill function, etc.).  Those can/will be added in in the very near future.  If you wish to fork and/or submit a pull request to it to add more functionalities, please let me know and I will add a license.

To test, make sure you have NodeJS installed.  Enjoy!
